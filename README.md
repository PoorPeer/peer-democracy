# peer-democracy
Peer Democracy (PD) is a new model of democracy that combines digital technology with structural safeguards to create a global platform where billions of people can debate and vote securely. The aim is to create an equal, democratic, AI-supported decision system without hierarchies. Each decision carries real legal weight, and the system is designed to balance user-friendliness with airtight security.

## Features

- **Create Proposals**: Anyone can submit political proposals using the app.
- **Gather Support**: Proposals need support from a certain number of users to proceed.
- **Review and Improve**: Other users can comment and suggest improvements.
- **Ranking**: Users can vote on the best proposals.
- **Final Voting**: The most popular proposals go to a final vote.
- **Decision and Implementation**: Winning proposals are implemented.

## Technology

Peer Democracy uses the following technologies:

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum for smart contracts and transparency.
- **AI**: GPT-3/GPT-4 for moderation and translation.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for end-to-end encryption.
- **Biometric Verification**: OpenCV for facial recognition.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for hosting.
